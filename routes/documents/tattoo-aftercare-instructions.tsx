              <br />Saniderm Bandage
            </h3>

            <p class="mb-4">
              Leave the bandage (Saniderm) on for a minimum of 24 hours, up to 3
              days. It's going to fill up with excess ink/blood which is normal.
              If it starts leaking, go ahead and take it off.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              If you would like to replace the bandage replace it and use
              Saniderm throughout your healing process, it can be bought on
              Amazon or directly through the Saniderm website.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              The instructions for using Saniderm throughout the healing process
              are provided on their website. Saniderm is great for cuts and
              scrapes as well. The area it is applied to <strong>ALWAYS</strong>
              {" "}
              needs to be clean and dry.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
              If you notice a red line along the edge of the bandage, pull back
              the edge just enough to release the skin without creating an
              opening to the tattoo. On sensitive areas, the bandage may pull on
              the skin, which could cause irritation.
            </p>

            <p>
              When you remove the bandage, it's best to do so in the shower.
              That way it can easily be washed. We suggest a mild soap such as
              Dove. Gently wash it and pat it dry. Wait until it is completely
              dry and then it is ready to be moisturized.

            </h3>

            <p class="mb-4">
              It needs to be washed morning and night each day until healed. No
              need to "scrub" but just enough to clean the area. We recommend
              Aquaphor to moisturize the area during the healing process.
              Aquaphor spray is great to use and my first choice.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you get the original Aquaphor, massage it in the tattoo well
              and pat off any excess. You don't want a layer sitting on top of
              it. When this happens, the tattoo will be more susceptible to
              scabbing. Only apply the moisturizer if the skin feels dry and
              tight.

            <p class="mb-4">
              Redness and swelling is normal. You can take Ibuprofen to relieve
              your inflammation. Don't wrap your tattoo once the Saniderm is off
              (If we provided you with a Saniderm bandage). At this point, the
              area neeeds to stay clean and breathe.
            </p>

            <p>
              Do not use lidocaine patches or any other lidocaine product during
              the healing process. Doing so is not beneficial and can result in
              compromising the healing process.

            </h3>

            <p class="mb-4">
              The average healing time is 1-2 weeks. It varies from person to
              person as everyone's body is different. It's very common for
              tattoos to itch toward the end of the healing process. When/if
              this happens, massage in the moisturizer and it will relieve it.
              If you have any questions at all, message me at any time and I'll
              respond as quickly as I can.
            </p>

            <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mb-4">
              <li class="mb-4">
                Stay out of sunlight and tanning booth until your Tattoo is
                healed, at least 2 weeks.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-4">
                Do not soak in a tub, sauna, Jacuzzi or go swimming while your
                new Tattoo is healing. Showers are fine.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-4">
                Do not rub or pick the treated area while it is healing. Loss of
                color and/or infection could occur.
              </li>
              <li class="mb-4">
                AFTER your Tattoo is healed, Extreme sun and exposure over the
                years can and will fade your Tattoo. This can be minimized by
                using a strong sunscreen, at least SPF25.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your Tattoo should heal in approximately 2 weeks. Consult a
                physician if any signs or symptoms develop such as the
                following: redness at the site, green/yellow discharge (foul
                smelling) and/or fever.
