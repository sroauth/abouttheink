        <section id="Saniderm_Bandage">
          <h2>Saniderm Bandage</h2>

          <p>
            Leave the Saniderm bandage on for at least 24 hours, up to three
            days. It is normal for the bandage to fill up with excess ink and
            blood. If it starts leaking, go ahead and take it off.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you want to change the bandage during the healing process,
            replace it using Saniderm. You can buy it on Amazon or straight from
            the Saniderm website.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can find Saniderm usage instructions on their website. Saniderm
            works well for cuts and scrapes too. <strong>Always</strong>{" "}
            ensure that the area you apply it to is clean and dry.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you see a red line on the bandage's edge, pull back the edge
            enough to release the skin. Take care to avoid creating an opening
            to the tattoo. On sensitive areas, the bandage may pull on the skin,
            which could cause irritation.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you remove the bandage, it's best to do so in the shower. That
            way you can wash it right away. Use a mild soap such as Dove. Gently
            wash it and pat it dry. Wait until it is completely dry before you
            moisturize it.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="Moisturizing">
          <h2>Moisturizing</h2>

          <p>
            Wash your tattoo morning and night each day until healed. No need to
            "scrub," but enough to clean the area. We recommend Aquaphor to
            moisturize the area during the healing process. Aquaphor spray is
            great to use and our first choice.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you get the original Aquaphor, massage it in the tattoo well and
            pat off any excess. You don't want a layer sitting on top of it.
            When this happens, the tattoo will be more susceptible to scabbing.
            Only apply the moisturizer if the skin feels dry and tight.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="Inflammation">
          <h2>Inflammation</h2>

          <p>
            Redness and swelling is normal. You can take Ibuprofen to relieve
            your inflammation. Don't wrap your tattoo once the Saniderm is off
            (If we provided you with a Saniderm bandage). At this point, the
            area neeeds to stay clean and breathe.
          </p>

          <p>
            Do not use <strong>any</strong>{" "}
            lidocaine products during the healing process. Doing so is not
            beneficial and can result in compromising the healing process.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>
              Do not pick at, pull off any skin or scratch the tattoo.
            </strong>
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="Healing_Process">
          <h2>Healing Process</h2>

          <p>
            The average healing time is between one to two weeks. It varies from
            person to person as everyone's body is different. It is very common
            for tattoos to itch toward the end of the healing process. If this
            happens, massage in the moisturizer and it will relieve it. If you
            have any questions at all, message us at any time and we will
            respond as quick as we can.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Stay out of sunlight and tanning booth until your tattoo is
              healed, at least two weeks.
            </li>
            <li>
              Do not soak in a tub, sauna, jacuzzi or go swimming while your new
              tattoo is healing. Showers are fine.
            </li>
            <li>
              Do not rub or pick the treated area while it is healing. Loss of
              color or infection could occur.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>After</strong>{" "}
              your tattoo is healed, extreme sun and exposure over the years
              will fade your tattoo. This can be minimized by using a strong
              sunscreen, at least SPF25.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your tattoo should heal in approximately two weeks. Consult a
              physician if any signs or symptoms develop such as the following:
              redness at the site, foul smelling green/yellow discharge, or
              fever.
            </li>
          </ol>
